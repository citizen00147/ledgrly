Ledgrly is a simple note taking app that utilizes local storage over a database. This project is based on another note taking web app in a web development course I'm taking, but with several changes and fixes:

- A "retro" design
- Responsive
- Uses localstorage to save & retrieve notes
- A modal box that explains the app's purpose
- Fixed an issue that causes the footer to overlap the notes

## How to use

It's simple: click or tap in the textbox to begin typing. Add a title and your content. Post your note via the "log" button. Your message will be saved. No formating, bolding, italizing, sizing, etc. Just text.
